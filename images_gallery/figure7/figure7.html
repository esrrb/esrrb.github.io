	<strong>Figure 7. Hierarchy of pluripotency gene networks. </strong>&nbsp;
	<br>(A) Signed and directed pluripotency network constructed based on knockdown (and/or knockout) differentiation studies in combination with in vivo TF binding analyses (Table S6, fraction of predicted targets are shown). The red arrows show activating and the blue hammerhead edges show repressive links between the genes. Edge thickness represents the level of experimental support based on all analyzed independent data sources (Table S6). Esrrb is tightly linked with other core pluripotency factors, including Nanog and Sox2. (B-D) Emerging information-processing circuits in the context of the gene network shown in (A). (B) Nanog-Esrrb module, responsible for interpretation and processing external signals, such as Gsk3/Tcf signalling, targeting Esrrb and Nanog, or Lif signalling targeting Nanog and Klfs (Lif is not shown, Klf4 is shown on the panel (A). The Nanog-Esrrb module largely contains multiple coherent feed-forward loops. (C) Feedback control circuits, such as Oct4-Nanog-Sall4 (see the panel (A)) are responsible for controlling Oct4 concentration by the downstream pluripotency genes (shown in a box); largely represented by incoherent feed-forward loops with a feedback. Oct4 regulation by Sall4 is suggested by several recent studies (Buganim et al., 2012). (D) Pluripotency maintenance unit, Oct4 and Sox2 synergistically activate most of pluripotency genes, this unit also consists of coherent feed-forward loops. </body>
