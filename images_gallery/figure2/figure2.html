	<span class="style_bold">Figure 2. Meta-analysis of differentiation reveals Oct4-Sox2 activation domain.</span><br>(A) Multidimensional network constructed from time-series data encompassing 1563 genes/gene-products and 5 types of dynamic measurements (levels of mRNA, protein, promoter DNA methylation, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3). The network shows the presence of two global clusters largely corresponding to the pluripotent or differentiating states. Green and blue nodes represent pluripotency and differentiation markers, respectively. (B) Distribution of Esrrb target genes in the network shows that the majority are localized in the pluripotency cluster. (C) Genes with changing promoter DNA methylation levels (green nodes) are highly represented in the pluripotency cluster. In contrast, genes with changing H3K27me3 levels (blue nodes) are preferentially localized in the differentiation cluster. (D) The largest interconnected subnetwork, containing pluripotency genes and their direct neighbours (see pluripotency cluster in A). Pluripotency "seed” genes are represented by large circles, direct Esrrb targets are in red and a hit from a high-content shRNA screen is in blue. Oct4 occupies the central position in the network with the majority of Esrrb target genes as close neighbours. (E-G) Distribution of selected GO terms in the pluripotency and differentiation clusters. Only GO terms significantly enriched in the selected set of 1563 genes/gene-products were considered. Genes present in the differentiation cluster show enrichment in cytoskeleton, actin binding, cell adhesion and Wnt signalling categories. (H-K) Dynamic expression profiles for genes/gene-products included in the network (see D). Four types of data (mRNA, protein, promoter DNA methylation and H3K4me3) are shown. Dynamic changes within each regulatory layer are in good agreement among all genes. (L) Validation of predicted expression levels for Rnf125, Zscan10, Dppa2, Krr1; gene expression changes were measured by qRT-PCR. All data are represented as mean ± SD; n=3 and p&lt;0.05 (one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post-test). (See also Table S1). </div>
