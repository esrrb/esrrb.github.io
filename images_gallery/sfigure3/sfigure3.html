	<strong>Standard deviations in promoter methylation data. DNA methylome dynamics after Esrrb or Nanog depletion. In relation to Figure 2.
	<br />
	</strong>T(A) The figure shows errors in measurement of promoter methylation for genes shown in the Fig 2J. The errors were calculated based on biological replicas and are represented as standard deviations interpolated to the entire time course of differentiation. (B) Hierarchical clustering of the set of genes with significant changes in promoter methylation after depletion of Esrrb or Nanog. GO categories are depicted for the groups of genes whose methylation profiles follow the same trend or an opposite trend in the Esrrb versus Nanog time course.
