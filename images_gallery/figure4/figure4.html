	<strong>Figure 4. Esrrb regulated mRNA/miR feed-forward network motif. <br />
	</strong>
	(A) Schematic view of the Esrrb regulated feed-forward network motif. Esrrb directly regulates expression of many miRs, which in turn regulate expression levels of Esrrb protein-coding target genes. (B) Representation of the day 3 network linking together Esrrb, miR target genes and their predicted mRNA targets. Esrrb is the central rectangle, protein-coding and miR-coding target genes are designated by circles and triangles, respectively. Edges are formatted either in bright orange arrows or blue dotted hammerheads representing observed transcriptional regulation by Esrrb or the predicted repression of target genes by miRs, respectively. The experimentally confirmed miR-target gene interactions between mmu-mir-291a-3p and CDKN1A are highlighted in thick solid blue line. Nodes are colored with a gradient ranging from dark blue representing maximum negative log2 fold change to bright orange for maximum positive log2 fold change, relative to day 0 levels. Figure S6 contains such networks from all three time-points after Esrrb depletion as well as networks created using experimentally validated miRs-gene interactions. (C) Detected network motif types connecting Esrrb, miRs and their mRNA targets. (D) Observed occurrences of different kinds of Esrrb-miR motifs according to time points (dark grey) and their null distribution derived from network randomization by edge shuffling (light grey). (E) Fold changes for specific miR hubs from our miR-seq and microarray data. These miRs were identified in motifs in all three time course networks. </div></div>
