	<strong>Figure S7. Functional annotation of genes targeted by Esrrb-specific miRs.<br />
	</strong>The figure shows enrichment of terms for 36 genes targeted by 3 and more micro RNAs selectively regulated by Esrrb. The data has been obtained using "Enrichr" program available online: <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/">http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/</a>.  (A) Gene Ontology (GO) terms for biological process, the top terms include "regulation of cell proliferation", “cell-cell signaling" and “regulation of cell adhesion". (B) Enrichment of reactome terms obtained using the same tool. The top pathways include VEGF signaling, signaling by Notch and BMP4 Signaling. (C) Enrichment of reactome terms for the genes targeted by miR hubs identified over the whole time-course (Figure S6). (D) Comparison between three datasets including expression of genes upon removal of mouse Esrrb, mouse Nanog and human Nanog. Hierarchical clustering of the gene expression profiles, tight linkage between the two mouse genes is apparent. (E) Comparison of a subset of genes nearly identically (correlation r > 0.7) expressed in the mouse datasets with expression of the corresponding human genes. (F) Venn diagram shows the number of observed (in black) and the expected (in red) genes nearly identically expressed among the three datasets. One can see a very significant overlap between the three datasets (191 genes vs. 17 expected from random), supporting tight linkage between the three regulators.
