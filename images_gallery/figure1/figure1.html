	<strong>Figure 1. Experimental strategy and data integration.<br />
	</strong>(A) Schematic representation of transgenic construct used to deplete Esrrb in order to promote differentiation of mESCs. Lentiviral vector for conditional expression of Esrrb is shown on the top (Ivanova et al., 2006). Endogenous Esrrb is depleted with short hairpin (sh) RNA and complemented by an shRNA “immune” version of Esrrb expressed in a doxycycline (Dox)-dependent manner. Removal of Dox results in downregulation of the exogenous Esrrb leading to differentiation. FLAP is a nucleotide segment that improves transduction efficiency; hH1P-Esrrb is the endogenous Esrrb specific shRNA cassette (in blue); pTRE-Esrrb is GFP-tagged exogenous Esrrb cassette (in green); WRE is the woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element. (B) Experimental time course, analysed data types and data integration strategy. At the initial day 0 time point, Esrrb is expressed in the presence of Dox; at day 1, 3 and 5 time points Esrrb is downregulated following removal of Dox. Each data type (epigenetic, transcriptional, mRNA and proteomic) is collected at each time point and integrated into a single multi-dimensional time-series data set. (See also Figure S1).</div>
