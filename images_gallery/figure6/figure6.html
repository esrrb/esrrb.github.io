	<strong>Figure 6. Predicted time delay responses in the Esrrb-Nanog domain. </strong>&nbsp;
	<br>(A) Hierarchical clustering of expression changes of Esrrb and Nanog targets during both downregulation time courses. The black, gray and white map on the right shows classification of the target gene responses as fast, medium or slow, respectively; the fourth and fifth columns mark direct targets of Oct4 and/or Sox2, respectively. (B) A mechanism and a model for the time-delay switch. Both Nanog and Esrrb regulate target genes from Groups I and III either positively (red arrows) or negatively (blue arrows). If stimulus (input) comes into the coherent FFL loops via one of the two upstream regulators, expression of the second one would cause a response delay in expression of the target gene (shown in the model below the network motif). (C) Experimental validation of the delayed or “slow” predicted responses. Expression levels of Mllt6, Nefl, Trim25, Spred2, and Sumo3 measured by qRT-PCR following Esrrb depletion (top panel) or Nanog depletion (lower panel). All data are represented as mean ± SD; n=3 and p<0.05 (one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post-test). (D) Methylation levels of Mllt6, Nefl, Trim25, Spred2, and Sumo3 promoter regions after Esrrb or Nanog depletion are consistent with the observed response dynamics. </body>
