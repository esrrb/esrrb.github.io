	<strong>Coexpression clustering of mRNA and protein time series data.
<br />
	</strong>(A) The figure shows coexpression clustering of data containing genes significantly changing their mRNA and their protein levels. Cluster #1 shows genes upregulated upon Esrrb removal in both analysed dimensions. This cluster contains many differentiation markers, such as Gata6. Cluster #5 shows genes downgulated upon Esrrb, this cluster contains most pluripotency genes (labelled in red). Cluster #4 contains genes, where protein expression is delayed relatively to mRNA expression, Clusters #3 and #2 contain genes, where various significant discordances between the mRNA and the protein levels are observed.
