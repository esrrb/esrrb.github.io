	<strong>Figure S4.  Direct regulation of miR expression by Esrrb. 
<br />
	</strong>(A)  Esrrb binding in miR gene promoter regions. (B) Venn diagram showing the overlaps among miR genes bound by Esrrb, and those bound by Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. Binding sites were identified over a 5 kb distance from the transcription start site (TSS). Numbers in parentheses represent the total number of miR genes bound by each respective TF. (C) Venn diagram showing the overlap between  the 35 specific miR targets of Esrrb and miRs that significantly change in expression after Esrrb knockdown. (D) Hierarchical clustering of the miRs that are specifically regulated by Esrrb, but not by Oct4, Sox2 or Nanog that significantly change in expression after Esrrb knockdown. (E) Gene Ontology analysis of genes targeted by miRs that have been experimentally validated by miRTarbase and are specifically regulated by Esrrb but not by Oct4, Sox2 or Nanog. Expression levels are represented as ratios of the median. (F) Genome Browser screenshot of the Esrrb binding site in the promoter region of the mmu-mir-290-295 cluster. (G) Quantitative PCR measurements of changes in pri-mmu-mir-290-295 expression levels. (H) Reads in log2 scale for changes in mmu-mir-290-295 expression.
