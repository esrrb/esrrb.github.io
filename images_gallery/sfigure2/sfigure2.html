	<strong>Visualization of dynamic changes across the analyzed data dimensions. In relation to Figure 2. 
	<br />
	</strong> The dynamic changes are shown by colours in the context of the clusters shown in the Figure 2. The colour scale changes from red (maximal expression) to green (absence of expression), see also the colour bar in the left top corner. (Panels A-D) Changes in the mRNA levels, (E-H) Changes in the protein levels, (I-L) Changes in the promoter methylation, (M-P) Changes in the level of H3K4me3 methylation, (Q-R) Changes in the level of H3K27me3 methylation. The dynamics has been also represented in Movie S1.</div>
