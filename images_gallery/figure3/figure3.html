</span></b></strong>(A) Schematic view of the Esrrb regulated feed-forward network motif. Esrrb directly regulates expression of many miRs, which in turn regulate expression levels of Esrrb protein-coding target genes. (B) Detected network motif types connecting Esrrb, miRs and their mRNA targets. (C, D, E) Representation of the day 1, day 3 and day 5 respectively networks linking together Esrrb, miR target genes and their experimentally validated mRNA targets. Esrrb is the central rectangle, protein-coding and miR-coding target genes are designated by circles and triangles, respectively. Edges are formatted either in bright orange arrows or blue hammerheads representing experimentally validated repression of target genes by miRs, respectively. Nodes are coloured with a gradient ranging from dark blue representing maximum negative log2 fold change to bright orange for maximum positive log2 fold change, relative to day 0 levels. (F) Observed occurrences of different kinds of Esrrb-miR motifs according to time points (dark grey) and their null distribution derived from network randomization by edge shuffling (light grey). </div>
